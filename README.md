## üìä Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Launch Application**: Start the development server and navigate to the dashboard
2. **Select Asset**: Choose from available volatility indices (R_10, R_25, R_50, etc.)
3. **Configure Risk Settings**: Set stake amount, risk limits, and probability thresholds
4. **Start Analysis**: Click "Start Analysis" to begin real-time market monitoring

### Asset Selection
- **Standard Indices**: R_10, R_25, R_50, R_75, R_100 (updated every ~2 seconds)
- **High-Frequency Indices**: R_10_1S, R_25_1S, etc. (updated every second)
- **Timeframe Options**: 1-minute or 5-minute analysis windows

### Risk Management
- **Probability Threshold**: Minimum confidence level for signal generation (50%-90%)
- **Required Runs**: Number of consensus runs needed (2-4 out of 4 total runs)
- **Stake Management**: Base stake amount with optional martingale progression
- **Loss Limits**: Maximum consecutive losses and daily loss caps

### Signal Generation
1. **Automatic Mode**: Signals generated when consensus and confidence thresholds are met
2. **Manual Mode**: Force signal generation for current top prediction
3. **Export Options**: Download Binary Bot XML for immediate import
4. **Signal History**: Track all generated signals with status updates

### XML Bot Integration
1. **Generate Signal**: Wait for high-confidence prediction or manually trigger
2. **Export XML**: Click "Export XML" button to download bot file
3. **Import to Deriv Bot**: Upload XML file directly to Binary Bot interface
4. **Execute Strategy**: Run the imported strategy with your configured parameters

## üîß Configuration Options

### Trading Parameters
- **Stake Amount**: Base trade amount in USD
- **Martingale Multiplier**: Multiplier for loss recovery (1.0x - 3.0x)
- **Contract Duration**: Automatic based on asset type (5 ticks for 1s, 10 ticks for standard)

### Analysis Settings
